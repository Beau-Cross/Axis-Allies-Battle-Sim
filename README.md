# Axis-Allies-Battle-Sim
I was sick and tired of my all tank stategy losing so I decided to write this program to give me an idea of what builds will beat another.
This program is also a tool to help understand the underlying math that governs the balance of the game.

*Note:*
When using this program, I'd reccommend simulating anywhere from 1 thousand to 1 million games to get an answer in a reasonable time frame.
I usually do 200 thousand games.
Extra depth past 1 million is not needed because the win percentages converge close enough to their theoretical value, and according to the law of large numbers adding more iterations just gives a more precise answer.
